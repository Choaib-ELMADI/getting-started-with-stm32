# Getting Started with STM32

This repository documents my journey with STM32 microcontrollers while studying "Mastering STM32 - Second Edition" book by Carmine Noviello. The goal is to reinforce concepts, explore embedded systems development, and share useful resources.

## Contents

- **Docs**: Notes extracted from the book.
- **Examples**: C and Assembly programs.
- **Projects**: Practical implementations and experiments.
- **Mastering STM32 - Second Edition.pdf**: The original PDF file of the book.

## STM32 Animations

I've also created some video animations using `Manim` to visualize some STM32 concepts. These animations aim to simplify complex topics and enhance learning. You can check them out in [manim-animation](https://github.com/Choaib-ELMADI/manim-animation).

## Goals

- To build a solid understanding of STM32 microcontrollers.
- To document and reinforce learning through notes, code, and animations.
- To provide resources that help others get started with STM32 development.
