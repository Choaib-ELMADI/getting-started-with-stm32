# Getting Started with STM32

This repository documents my journey with STM32 microcontrollers while studying "Mastering STM32 - Second Edition" book by Carmine Noviello. The goal is to reinforce concepts, explore embedded systems development, and share useful resources.

## Development Board:

I'm using the `Nucleo-F446RE` board for learning and experimenting with STM32 microcontrollers. This board is based on the `STM32F446RET6` MCU and provides a great balance between performance and flexibility for embedded systems development.

## Contents

- **Docs**: Notes extracted from the book.
- **Examples**: C and Assembly programs.
- **Projects**: Practical implementations and experiments.
- **Nucleo-F446RE**: Contains all the original projects and examples from the book repo.
- **Mastering STM32 - Second Edition.pdf**: The original PDF file of the book.

## STM32 Development Tools

Here are some essential tools for STM32 development:

- **[STM32CubeIDE](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeide.html)**: An all-in-one IDE that integrates a compiler, debugger, and project manager for STM32 development.
- **[STM32CubeMX](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubemx.html)**: A graphical tool to configure STM32 microcontrollers and generate initialization code.
- **[STM32CubeProgrammer](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeprog.html)**: A tool for flashing firmware onto STM32 microcontrollers via various interfaces.
- **[STM32CubeCLT](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeclt.html)**: A command-line tool for building, debugging, and flashing STM32 projects.
- **[STMCUFinder](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/st-mcu-finder-pc.html)**: A search tool to find STM32 and STM8 microcontrollers and their technical documentation.

## STM32 Animations

I've also created some video animations using `Manim` to visualize some STM32 concepts. These animations aim to simplify complex topics and enhance learning. You can check them out in [manim-animation](https://github.com/Choaib-ELMADI/manim-animation).

## Goals

- To build a solid understanding of STM32 microcontrollers.
- To document and reinforce learning through notes, code, and animations.
- To provide resources that help others get started with STM32 development.
