1. ARM Cortex-M:
    . Cortex-M has separate data and instruction buses hence it is a Harvard architecture.

2. Registers:
    . Registers are storage elements inside a processor core.
    . Registers are grouped as register banks.
    . Cortex-M architecture has 16 different registers:
        - R0  |
        - R1  |
        - R2  |
        - R3  |
        - R4  |
        - R5  |
        - R6  |-> General Purpose Registers (divided into: Higher and Lower registers)
        - R7  |
        - R8  |
        - R9  |
        - R10 |
        - R11 |
        - R12 |

        - R13 (SP) |
        - R14 (LR) |-> Special Function Registers
        - R15 (PC) |

        - PSR       |
        - PRIMASK   |
        - FAULTMASK |-> Other Special Registers
        - BASEPRI   |
        - CONTROL   |
