1. General Purpose Input/Output Pins:
    . A microcontroller pins can be used for:
        - Reading digital signals -> if configured as INPUT
        - Generating triggers     -> if configured as OUTPUT
        - Issuing interrupts      -> if configured as EXTERNAL INTERRUPT PIN

    . A GPIO Port is just a collection of fixed number of I\O pins:
        -  8-bit GPIO port -->  8 pins
        - 16-bit GPIO port --> 16 pins
        - 32-bit GPIO port --> 32 pins
