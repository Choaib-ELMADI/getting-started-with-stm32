1. Timers Applications:
    . Generating time delays
    . Measuring pulses frequency
    . Generating PWM signals
    . Triggering external devices or peripherals

2. Types of Timers:
    . A timer is actually a counter that counts time, and there are two types:
        - UP Counter: counts from 0 to a preprogrammed value (also called 'period')!
        - DOWN Counter: counts from a preprogrammed value to 0!

3. STM32 Nucleo-F446RE Timers:
    . There are three types of timers in the Nucleo-F446RE board:
        - Basic Timer           -> TIMER6 and TIMER7
        - General Purpose Timer -> TIMER2 to TIMER5 (32-bit) and TIMER9 to TIMER14 (16-bit)
        - Advanced Timer        -> TIMER1 and TIMER8

    . CNTx_CLK = TIMx_CLK / (PRESCALER + 1), with:
        > CNTx_CLK  --> Prescaler output, which is our desired clock frequency
        > TIMx_CLK  --> Used MCU clock frequency
        > PRESCALER --> Prescaler configured value

    . In this case, the time for one tick (aka 'timer period') of the timer is: 1 / CNTx_CLK second(s).

    . Based on our required time delay, and the calculated timer period, we load the appropriate preprogrammed value.

    . For a 1s delay, we calculated these values for TIMER6: FR = 16MHz, PRESCALER = 15999, PERIOD = 1000
    . TIMER6 configuration steps:
        - Open 'CubeMX' software
        - Complete the initial board / MCU setup
        - Under 'Clock Configuration' tab, for the 'System Clock Mux', select 'HSI' and make sure 'HCLK (MHz)' is set to 16
        - Under 'Pinout & Configuration', under 'Timers', click TIM6
        - Check the 'Activated' checkbox
        - In 'Parameter Settings', set the prescaler and the counter period
        - In 'NVIC Settings', enable TIM6 global interrupt
