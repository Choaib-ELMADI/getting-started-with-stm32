1. Enabling Interrupts in STM32:
    . Only Reset, NMI, and Hard Fault exceptions are enabled at boot; others must be manually enabled.
    . Each interrupt is identified by an IRQn_Type enumeration, defined in a device-specific header file.
    . The NVIC controller manages interrupts, but peripherals must also be configured for interrupt mode.
    . Peripheral interrupts (USART2_IRQn, ...) require both NVIC-level and peripheral-level enabling.
    . Disabling interrupts follows a similar process.
