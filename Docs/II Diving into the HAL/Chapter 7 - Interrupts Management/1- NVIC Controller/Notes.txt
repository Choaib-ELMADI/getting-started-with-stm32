1. NVIC Controller:
    . The Nested Vectored Interrupt Controller (NVIC) is a hardware unit that manages exceptions in Cortex-M microcontrollers.
    . NVIC handles two types of peripherals:
        - Internal peripherals (timers, UARTs, ...)
        - External peripherals (buttons, Ethernet PHY, ...)
    . The External Interrupt\Event Controller (EXTI) connects external I\O signals to NVIC.
    . ARM differentiates between:
        - System exceptions (originating inside the CPU core)
        - Interrupt Requests (IRQ) from external peripherals
    . ISRs (Interrupt Service Routines) are linked to interrupts via a vector table.
