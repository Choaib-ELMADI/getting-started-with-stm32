1. NVIC Controller:
    . The Nested Vectored Interrupt Controller (NVIC) is a hardware unit that manages exceptions in Cortex-M microcontrollers.
    . NVIC handles two types of peripherals:
        - Internal peripherals (timers, UARTs, ...)
        - External peripherals (buttons, Ethernet PHY, ...)
    . The External Interrupt\Event Controller (EXTI) connects external I\O signals to NVIC.
    . ARM differentiates between:
        - System exceptions (originating inside the CPU core)
        - Interrupt Requests (IRQ) from external peripherals
    . ISRs (Interrupt Service Routines) are linked to interrupts via a vector table.

2. Vector Table in STM32:
    . Cortex-M processors have 15 fixed system exceptions, with some reserved for future use.
    . Key exceptions:
        - Reset: Entry point for firmware execution.
        - NMI (Non-Maskable Interrupt): High-priority exception, linked to Clock Security System (CSS).
        - Hard Fault: Catches unhandled exceptions.
        - Memory Management Fault: Triggered by illegal memory access.
        - Bus Fault: Caused by invalid memory access or bus errors.
        - Usage Fault: Occurs due to illegal instructions or misalignment.
        - SVCall (Supervisor Call): Used in RTOS for privilege escalation.
        - Debug Monitor: Raised during debugging events.
        - PendSV: Supports context switching in RTOS.
        - SysTick: A timer interrupt, commonly used in RTOS and ST CubeHAL.
    . Cortex-M cores support different numbers of IRQs:
        - Cortex-M0/0+: Up to 32 external interrupts.
        - Cortex-M3/4/7: Up to 240 external interrupts.
        - Cortex-M33: Up to 480 external interrupts.

3. Vector Table Location and Configuration:
    . The vector table starts at address 0x00000000 by default.
    . In STM32 MCUs, it is often placed in flash memory at 0x08000000.
    . It contains:
        - The Main Stack Pointer (MSP) at the first entry.
        - Exception and interrupt handler addresses.
        > Cortex-M0/0+: 48 entries in the vector table.
        > Cortex-M3/4/7: 256 entries.
    . Vector table relocation is possible in Cortex-M (except Cortex-M0).
    . GNU Linker (GCC LD) ensures the vector table is correctly placed in flash memory.
