# Learning Goals:

This chapter introduces the fundamentals of GPIO (General-Purpose Input/Output) management in STM32 microcontrollers:

- Understanding how GPIOs allow the MCU to communicate with external peripherals
- Exploring the HAL_GPIO module in STM32CubeHAL and its functions
- Understanding how STM32 peripherals are mapped to logical addresses
- Understanding how STM32 peripherals are represented inside the HAL library
