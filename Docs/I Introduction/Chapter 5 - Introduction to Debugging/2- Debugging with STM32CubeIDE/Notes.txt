1. Debugging with STM32CubeIDE:
    . Debug Perspective in Eclipse provides essential debugging tools.
    . Start Debugging: Click the Debug icon, then confirm the perspective switch.

    . Debug View            : Shows active debug sessions and the call stack.
    . Variables View        : Inspect and modify variable values.
    . Breakpoints View      : Lists and manages breakpoints.
    . Editor View           : Double-click next to a line to set a breakpoint.
    . Registers & SFR Views : Display hardware and core registers.

    . Step Into   : Execute the next line and enter functions.
    . Step Over   : Execute the next line without entering functions.
    . Resume      : Continue execution until the next breakpoint.
    . Terminate   : End the debug session.
    . Watchpoints : Conditional breakpoints that halt execution only when a specific variable meets a condition.

2. Debug Configurations:
    . Debug Configurations: Access via the debug icon -> Debug Configurations.
    . Main Tab: Specifies project name and binary file for debugging.
    . Debugger Tab:
        - GDB Connection Settings: Leave default settings.
        - Debug Probe: Uses ST-LINK (default).
        - Interface: Select SWD (default).
    . Reset Behavior (Fixes flashing/debugging issues):
        - Connect under reset (default).
        - Software system reset (via RCC register).
        - Hardware reset (reset pulse).
        - Core reset (only resets core, not peripherals).
    . Startup Tab:
        - Set breakpoint at main() (default).
        - Exception handling (divide by zero, unaligned access, halt on exception).
