1. Choosing the Right STM32 MCU:
    . Choose Based on Application Needs:
        - High-performance (CPU-intensive tasks, multimedia) -> STM32H7, STM32F7
        - Mainstream       (cost-sensitive, general use)     -> STM32F1, STM32G4
        - Low-power        (battery-powered devices)         -> STM32L series
        - Wireless         (Bluetooth, Sub-GHz, 2.4GHz)      -> STM32W series
    . Connectivity Requirements:
        - Ethernet, CAN bus, IP protocols                    -> STM32F4, STM32F105/7
    . Practical Considerations:
        - Target Market: Niche vs. mass-market (cost matters for high-volume production).
        - BOM Budget: Select the right MCU early to fit within cost limits.
        - Size Constraints: Small wearables vs. spacious designs affect MCU choice.
        - Manufacturing Feasibility: LQFP is easier; BGA/WLCSP needs advanced assembly.
        - Time-to-Market: Tight deadlines may require higher-power MCUs to simplify development.
        - Code & Layout Reuse: Sticking with familiar architectures speeds up development.
        - Availability: Due to supply chain issues, ensure stock before finalizing a design.
    . Pin-to-Pin Compatibility:
        - Allows switching to a more powerful or cheaper MCU later with minimal redesign.
    . Helpful Tools from ST:
        - STM32 & STM8 MCU Finder (integrated in STM32CubeIDE)
        - Mobile App (iOS & Android) for MCU selection.
