1. ARM Architectures and Cores:
    * The term ARM stands for "Advanced RISC Machine", and it refers to both:
        . A multitude of families of RISC architectures (Reduced Instruction Set Computing).
        . Several families of complete cores, which are the building blocks of CPUs.

    * An ARM architecture is a set of specifications that includes:
        . Instruction set
        . Execution model
        . Memory organization and layout
        . Instruction cycles
        . ...

    * Cortex-M is a family of physical cores designed to be integrated with vendor-specific silicon devices to form a finished microcontroller.

2. ARM Holdings:
    * ARM Holdings develops the instruction set and architecture for ARM-based products but does not manufacture devices.
    * ARM Holdings neither manufactures nor sells CPU devices based on its own designs, but rather licenses the processor architecture to interested parties.
