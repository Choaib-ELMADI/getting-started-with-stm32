1. Introduction:
    * The term ARM stands for "Advanced RISC Machine", and it refers to both:
        . A multitude of families of RISC architectures (Reduced Instruction Set Computing).
        . Several families of complete cores, which are the building blocks of CPUs.
        => The architecture used to design a processor is based on the cores in that processor.

    * An ARM architecture is a set of specifications that includes:
        . Instruction set
        . Execution model
        . Memory organization and layout
        . Instruction cycles
        . and more...

    * Cortex-M is a family of physical cores designed to be integrated with vendor-specific silicon devices.
