1. Cortex and Cortex-M Based Processors:
    * ARM Cortex is a wide set of 32 / 64-bit architectures and cores that are popular in the embedded world.
    * There are 3 main subfamilies of Cortex microcontrollers:
        - Cortex-A: (Application) => designed for devices undertaking complex computing tasks (hosting OS platforms, mobile devices, ...).
        - Cortex-M: (eMbedded)    => designed and optimized for low-cost embedded systems market (IoT, automation, connectivity, ...).
        - Cortex-R: (Real-time)   => designed for embedded systems where reliability, high availability, fault tolerance and real-time response are essential.

    * Cortex-M Core Registers:
        => View image: "./Images/Figure 1.2 - ARM Cortex-M core registers.png"

    * Memory Map:
        . ARM defines a standardized memory address space common to all Cortex-M cores.

        . Bit-banding is a feature that enables every single bit in the bit-band region to be directly accessible (r/w/m without a sequence of instructions).
        . Bit-band alias is a region in memory that stores the addresses of each bit in the bit-band region.
        => alias_address = (alias_base) + (32 * (bit_band_memory_address - bit_band_base)) + (bit * 4)
        => Example: alias_address_for_bit_0 = (0x22000000) + (32 * (bit_band_address_for_bit_0 - bit_band_base)) + (0 * 4) = 0x22000000

        . The "System memory" region is reserved to bootloaders, 0x1FFFX000 ---> ...
        . Each STM32 family provides a bootloader pre-programmed into the chip during production.
        . Bootloaders are used to load code from several peripherals into the RAM.

        . The "Option bytes" region contains a series of bit flags that are used to configure several aspects of the MCU.
