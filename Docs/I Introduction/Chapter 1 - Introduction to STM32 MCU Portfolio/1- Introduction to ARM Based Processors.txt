0. Introduction:
    * The term ARM stands for "Advanced RISC Machine", and it refers to both:
        . A multitude of families of RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computing) architectures.
        . Several families of complete cores, which are the building blocks of CPUs.
        => The architecture used to design a processor is based on the cores in that processor.

    * An ARM architecture is a set of specifications that includes:
        . The instruction set
        . Execution model
        . Memory organization and layout
        . Instruction cycles
        . and more...

    * Cortex-M is a family of physical cores designed to be integrated with vendor-specific silicon devices.

1. Cortex and Cortex-M Based Processors:
    * ARM Cortex is a wide set of 32 / 64-bit architectures and cores that are popular in the embedded world.
    * There are 3 main subfamilies of Cortex microcontrollers:
        - Cortex-A: (Application) => designed for devices undertaking complex computing tasks (hosting OS platforms, mobile devices, ...).
        - Cortex-M: (eMbedded)    => designed and optimized for low-cost embedded systems market (IoT, automation, connectivity, ...).
        - Cortex-R: (Real-time)   => designed for embedded systems where reliability, high availability, fault tolerance and real-time response are essential.
