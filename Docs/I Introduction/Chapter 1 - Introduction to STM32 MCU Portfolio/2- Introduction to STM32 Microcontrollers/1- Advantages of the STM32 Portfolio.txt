1. STM32 Portfolio Advantages:
    . Cortex-M Based: STM32 MCUs use ARM Cortex-M cores, ensuring compatibility with many development tools and a strong industry presence.
    . Free Development Tools: A fully free toolchain is available, making STM32 accessible for students and hobbyists.
    . Knowledge Reusability: Experience with one STM32 series can be easily applied to others.
    . Official IDE: ST now provides TrueSTUDIO (formerly Atollic) as the official STM32 development environment.
    . Pin-to-Pin Compatibility: Many STM32 MCUs share pin layouts, making it easier to switch between models without redesigning hardware.
    . 5V Tolerant Pins: Most GPIOs can handle 5V signals, reducing the need for level shifters.
    . Affordable 32-bit MCUs: The STM32F0 series offers a low-cost upgrade path from 8\16-bit microcontrollers.
    . Integrated Bootloader: Built-in bootloader supports programming via USART, I2C, and other interfaces, simplifying firmware updates.
