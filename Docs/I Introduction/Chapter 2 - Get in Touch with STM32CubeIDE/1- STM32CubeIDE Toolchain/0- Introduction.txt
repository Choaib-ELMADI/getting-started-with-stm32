1. Introduction:
    . STM32CubeIDE is now the official development environment for STM32 microcontrollers, replacing older fragmented toolchains.
    . ST acquired Atollic (TrueStudio IDE) in 2017, rebranding it as STM32CubeIDE and making it free.

2. Advantages of STM32CubeIDE:
    . GCC-Based: Uses a highly optimized, industry-standard compiler.
    . Cross-Platform: Works on Windows, MacOS, and Linux.
    . Eclipse-Based: Compatible with many Eclipse plugins and tools.
    . Open Source: Easier debugging and transparency.
    . Strong Community Support: Large user base, frequent updates, and extensive documentation.
    . Free to Use: A big advantage for students, hobbyists, and small businesses.

    => STM32CubeIDE integrates all STM32 tools into one package, making development smoother and more efficient.
