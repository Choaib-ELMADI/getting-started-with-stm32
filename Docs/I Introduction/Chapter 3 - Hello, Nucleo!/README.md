# Learning Goals:

This chapter introduces the first STM32 embedded application:

- Writing a basic blinking LED program
- Using STM32CubeIDE to create a complete application
- Getting familiar with the development environment
- Understanding the structure of an STM32 project (without diving into HAL and STM32CubeMX)
