1. Setting Up the Project:
    . Open STM32CubeIDE and navigate to: File -> New -> STM32 Project.
    . The Target Selection wizard will appear (may take time to load as it fetches the latest MCU and board specifications from ST's servers).
    . The wizard is part of STM32CubeMX, a tool that simplifies hardware configuration and peripheral initialization.

2. Selecting the Development Board:
    . Click on the Board Selector tab.
    . Expand the Type menu and select the board family.
    . Find and choose the specific board you are using.

3. Naming and Configuring the Project:
    . Click Next, then enter a Project Name.
    . Leave all other settings as default and click Finish to generate the project.
    . The IDE will ask if you want to initialize all peripherals with default mode. Click Yes to let the IDE handle initial configurations.

4. Downloading the Required Firmware Package:
    . If this is your first time creating a project for the selected STM32 family, STM32CubeIDE will download the corresponding Cube Firmware Package.
    . The package includes:
        - HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer) - Libraries for peripheral and core functionality.
        - Middleware Libraries             - Additional software for advanced peripherals (e.g., USB stack).
        - Example Projects                 - Pre-configured example applications for various STM32 boards.
    . The download size varies depending on the STM32 family; more powerful MCUs require larger firmware packages.
