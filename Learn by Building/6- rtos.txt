-> What is FreeRTOS?
    - An open-source real-time operating system (RTOS) designed for embedded systems and microcontrollers.

-> Why FreeRTOS?
    - FreeRTOS is ported to many important processor architectures:
        + ARM Cortex-M, ARM Cortex-A
        + AVR, PIC
        + ESP32
        + RISC-V
        + ...

    - FreeRTOS provides a kernel and various kernel-related services designed specifically for real-time applications.
    - These services help manage timing, synchronization, and coordination of tasks in an embedded system:
        + Task management
        + Time management
        + Memory management
        + Task notifications
        + Software timers (one-shot and periodic timers)
        + Intertask communication (Queues, Semaphores, Mutexes)
        + Event groups (a way to synchronize tasks based on multiple events)

-> How to use FreeRTOS in your project?
    - Download and integrate manually from the FreeRTOS website
    or
    - Use CMSIS-FreeRTOS from ARM
    or
    - Using STM32CubeIDE
