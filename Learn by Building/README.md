This folder lists projects and notes built while exploring embedded systems by building hands-on applications. Each project is implemented in the `Projects WS` folder and is linked below.

## Projects List

### [LED Blinker with GPIO](../Projects%20WS/LbD_LED_Blinker)

- **Goals**:

  - Get familiar with basic GPIO control
  - Usage of timers for time base generation
  - Usage of GPIO external interrupts
  - Usage of a logic analyzer for debugging and observing hardware

### [Orientation-based LED Control](../Projects%20WS/LbD_Orientation_LED_Control)

- **Goals**:

  - Reading data from the MPU6050 sensor using the I2C protocol
  - Stablize sensor readings using a Kalman Filter
  - Developping a mapping algorithm to convert values
  - Usage of PWM signals for control
  - Running FreeRTOS on STM32 microcontroller
