-> .elf (Executable and Linkable Format):
    - The content includes code, data, and detailed metadata, which incorporates debugging information and symbol tables.
    - If your goal is to flash and debug the code using debuggers, then use this format.

-> .bin (Binary):
    - Raw binary image of the compiled code and data. It lacks address information and metadata.
    - .bin files are used for programming a device memory where the programmer/bootloader already knows the exact memory address where to load the program.

-> .hex (Intel Hex Format):
    - ASCII text file format representing binary data along with address information and data integrity checksums.
    - .hex files include a checksum which can be used to verify the integrity of the data as it is programmed into memory, preventing errors during programming.

*---------------------------------------------------------------------*

- Power the board using a mini USB cable
- Open 'Device Manager' and note the virtual COM port number
- Put the board into boot mode:
    - Remove the jumper on JP6 (BOOT0 pin)
    - Press the reset button to ensure the MCU starts in boot mode
- Open 'CubeProgrammer' software
- Select 'UART' as the interface, then configure the COM port and baud rate
- Under 'Memory & File editing', click 'Open file' and select the .bin output file
- Click 'Connect' to establish communication
- Click 'Download' to flash the program
- Once done, press the reset button
- To exit boot mode:
    - Reconnect the jumper on JP6 (BOOT0 pin)
    - Press the reset button again
